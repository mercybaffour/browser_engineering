Welcome to my Web Browser Project! This is an ongoing learning journey where I am building a web browser from scratch to explore and understand the inner workings of modern web browsers. 

### **Project Overview**
The primary goal of this project is to dive deep into the core components that make up a web browser. Through this project, I am teaching myself the internals of web browsers, including HTML rendering, CSS parsing, JavaScript execution, and the overall browser architecture.

This browser is built using **Python** and **Tkinter** (a Python GUI toolkit), following along with the code & concepts discussed in [Web Browser Engineering](https://browser.engineering/). I'm currently reviewing Part 1, 2, and 3 before moving on to Part 4. Iâ€™ve also added detailed comments to facilitate learning and future development.

### **Key Features**
This project currently includes the following features:
- **Core URL Management**: Handles URLs and routing requests.
- **HTML Parsing**: Parses and interprets HTML content.
- **CSS Parsing**: Processes and applies CSS styles to HTML elements.
- **Styling and Layout**: Implements basic page styling and layout rendering.
- **Painting and Drawing Commands**: Responsible for rendering content on the screen.
- **Browser Interface**: Basic graphical user interface for interacting with the browser.

### **Areas for Improvement**
While the project has made significant progress, there are a few areas still under development:
- **Layout Issue**: Currently, new block elements fail to create new lines and instead stretch across the width of the page. This may be due to how the layout algorithm handles block-level elements. I'm investigating the behavior of the layout engine to fix this issue.

### **Future Goals**
- Improve block element layout handling to ensure proper line breaks and spacing.
- Enhance JavaScript execution capabilities.
- Optimize browser performance and support more complex web features.

> **Note**: This project is a work-in-progress and is being updated as I continue to learn and develop more browser components.
